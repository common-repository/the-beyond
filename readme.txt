Simply include **Beyond Links** to your articles from **Beyond** and preview them in **Beyond Embed panel**.

== Description ==

As you may know, many WordPress sites suffer from a large amount of content. That leads to losing your customer’s flow and missing your business goals. Content such as FAQ, Terms and Conditions, product documentation, repetitive information – these things are all needed but also very distracting, hard to maintain and increase demands on your support team.

That is why we have created **Beyond – to make it easier for users to reach conversion goals**. Users get extra content only when they need it. The content simply appears in **Beyond Embed Panel** after clicking on **Beyond Links**.

[**The Beyond**](https://www.getbeyond.io/?ref=wp_org) is a flexible space for all your content: FAQ, Terms of Conditions, comprehensive product documentation and any other unexciting but necessary content. Working with **Beyond** is highly intuitive so it will help your Support Team to reduce its workload to the minimum.

With this plugin **The Beyond for WordPress**, using **Beyond** on your **WordPress** site is a simple task.

Main plugin features:

* Automatically loads **Beyond Embed Panel** script.
* Adds shortcode for inserting **Beyond Link**.
* Adds button above WYSIWYG editor for simple shortcode inserting.
